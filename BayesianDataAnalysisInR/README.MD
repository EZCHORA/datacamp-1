# Fundamentals of Bayesian Data Analysis in R

# What is Bayesian Data Analysis.
- A method for figuring out unobservable quantities given known facts that uses probability to describe the uncertainty over what the values of the unknown quantities could be.
- **Bayesian Data Analysis** is the the use of *Bayes Inference* to learn from data.
- It can be used for most anything that we're already familiar with in Statisticl Modeling.
- Allows you to crate problem specific models.
- A **Probability Distribution** is a set of mutually exclusive potential results.
- The role of *probability distributinos* is to represent uncertainty.
- The role of Bayesian Inference is to update those uncertanties.
- Without data, Bayesian Inference assumes that all outcomes are equally likely.
- A **Prior Probability Distribution** is the uncertainty distribution prior to data.
- The **Posterior Distribution** is what was updated to after including data.
- A **Point Estimate** is used to summarize what is known about a parameter of interest.
