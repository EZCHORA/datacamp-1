# ARIMA Modeling with R

# Time Series Data and Models
- duder wrote a book.
- .. and a package `astsa`.
- White Noise is:
  1. Independent normals with common variance.
  2. Basic building blocks of time series.
- ARIMA is a combination of Autoregression and Moving Average.
- **Stationarity** is when the time series is "stable"; i.e.:
  1.  the Mean is constant.
  2. Correlation structure remains constant.
- **Wold Decomposition**: any stationary time series can be rewritten as a linear combination of white noise.
