# Simplifying Iteration and Lists With purrr
- Class is about purrr package.
- For loops are powerful but is where lots of typos show up.
- The *purrr* package puts the iteration into a single function.
- The function `map()` takes two arguments:
  1. `.x` which is a list or vector.
  2. `.f` which is the function to apply to.
- Lists require a different grammar than vectors.
- Lists can store different data types.
- When you use the variants of `map` that include the type, then you can get vectors back.
- For example, `map_dbl()` will return a vector of numbers.
