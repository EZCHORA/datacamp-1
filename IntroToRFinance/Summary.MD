- A **Vector** is a collection of data that is all the same type.
- `c()` stands for combine, not concatinate.
- `is.vector()` will return a logical about whether the object is a vector.
- You can add names to a vector using `names()`.
- The heirarchy of vector types is logical < integer < numeric < character.
- I know how the plot function works.
- The names you assign can be used to also look up the index.
- A matrix is a 2D vector.
- `matrix( values, nrow = <n_of_rows>, ncol = <n_of_cols>)`.
- You can alter the fill behavior by passing `byrow = TRUE`; this fills by row first.
- Matrices also only support one type of data.
- I know about `cor()`
