# Beginning Bayes in
## By Jim Albert

- Two schools of thought on Probability:
	1. Frequentist
	2. Bayesian
- *Subjective Probabilities*

- Jim has a package called **TeachBayes** which will help with the course.
	1. `spinner_plot( vector_of_values )`; create pie chart to visualize probabilities.
	2. `spinner_prob( vector_of_valeus )`; display data.frame of probabilities.
	3. `spinner_data( vector_of_values, samples)`; simulates a sampling from the vector.

- *Bayes Rule*: Named after Thomas Bayes (1702-1761)
- Paper called "Essays Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances" (1763)
- Approach:
	1. Identify model and collect **prior probabilites**.
	2. Collect Data.
	3. Use *Bayes Rule* to find **posterior probabilities**.
- If probabilities all the same, then you have a **uniform prior**.
- Meat of the rule: "Posterior Probability (=) is proportional to [Prior Prob.] x [Likelihood]"
- "Turn the bayesian crank."
- `bayesian_crank( bayes_data_frame )`; turn crank
- The posterier becomes your prior when 'cranking' the Bayesian 'crank'.
