# Writing your Own Functions
- You can define your own functions.
- The parts are the:
  * **Header**: function definition.
  * **Body**:
  * **Parameters**:
- **Docstrings** are used to describe what your function does.
- A **Tuple** is similar to a list but in that you cannot modify values.
- You can access both *list* and *tuple* values using **Zero-indexing**.
- You can unpack a tuple by simply putting the names on the left, and the tuple on the right.
  * The number of values must match.
