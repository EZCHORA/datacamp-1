# Data Wrangling
- This class is about introducing us to the Tidyverse.
- It's a general approach to solving data problems.
- You use the function `filter()` when you only want to check out a subset of your data.
- You use the function `%>%` to pipe the left hand side into the right hand side.
- The function `arrange()` sorts a table based on a variable.
- You can chain verbs together to build up to a result.
- The function `mutate()` will use other variables in the dataset to create a new column or update an existing one.
