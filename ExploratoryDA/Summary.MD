# Exploring Categorical Data
- Factors are the prefered way to deal with Categorical Variables.
- You can figure out the distinct values of a variable's factors using `levels()`.
- Please note that NAs are ignored by `levels()`.
- Take the ggplot course.
- You can get the probabilities of `table()` output by passing the results to `prop.table()`.
- You can include conditionality by passing 1 for rows and 2 for columns in `prop.table()`.
- DO NOT USE PIECHARTS.
