# Foundations of Inference
## Jo Hardin

## Introduction
- **Statistical Inference**: The proces of making claims about a population based on information from a sample.
- **Null Hypothesis**: The claim that is not interesting.
- *Alternative Hypothesis**: The claim that we're trying to prove.
- Goal is to reject the Null Hypothesis using sample data.

- We pick .05 for the sake of history:
```
"It is a common practice to judge a result significant, if it is of such a magnitude that it would have been produced by chance not more frequently than once in twenty trials...

The test of significance inly tells him what to ignore, namely all experiment in which significant results are not obtained. He should only claim that a phenomenom is experimentally demonstratable when he knows how to design an experiment." -R.A. Fisher (1929)
```

- What is a p-value?
- .. is the probability of observing data as or more extreme than what we actually got given that the null hypothesis is true.

- Errors in Hypothesis Testing:
	1. Inconsistent with the Null Hypothesis: Type I Error.
	2. Consistent with the Null Hypothesis  : Type II Error.
