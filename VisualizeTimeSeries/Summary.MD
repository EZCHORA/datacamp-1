# R Time Series Visualization Tools
- **xts** is a special class of object used to handle time series.
- It stands for extensible Time Series.
- Time Index + Data.
- The *index* must be a true time object.
- *Insert primier on graphs*.
- `sub = <Insert Subtitle Here?`.
- `pretty()` allows you to scale axis efficiently.
- You can create a highlighted period using `PerformanceAnaalytics::chart.TimeSeries( <data>, period.areas = <period>)`.
- The format for the period is `c(2014-01/2015-01)`.
- You can control the color using `period.color = "<color>"`.
