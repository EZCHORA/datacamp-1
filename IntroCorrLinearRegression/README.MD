# Intro to Statistics with R: Correlation and Linear Regression

# An Introduction to Correlation Coefficients
- We'll be learning about two ways to calculate r:
  1. Raw score formula.
  2. Z score formula.
- r is the degree to which X and Y vary together and relative to the degree that they vary independently.
- Formula: r = ( Covariance of X,Y )/ Variance( X, Y).
- **Correlation** is just a statistical procedure used to measure and describe the relationship between two variables.
- They can range between -1 and 1.
- The function `describe` will tell you the summary statistics for the data frame.
- You can use the function `cor()` to generate the pairwise Correlation Matrix.
- The function `cor.test()` can be used to test if the relationship between two variables is significant or not.
