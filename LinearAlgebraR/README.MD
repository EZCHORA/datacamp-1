# Introduction to Linear Algebra
- **Linear Algebra** is the study of linear systems of equations.
- The most basic unit is the **Vector** which is a collection on *N* elements.
- The **Traspose** of a vector is when you exchange the X and Y values along the diagonal axis.
- You can create vectors using the function `rep()`.
- You can create vectors with patterns using the function `seq()`.
- You can create a vector by the function `c()` and the values separated by a comma.
- **Matrices** are simply the superimposition of vectors.
- You can create a matrix using the function `matrix()`.
- The addition symbol on vectors adds them element by element.
-  A Matrix with M columns and N rows can only be multiplied by another matrix with M rows.
- To do **Matrix Multiplication**, you would use the operator `%*%`.
- Remember that `B%*%A` is not the same as `A%*%B`; order matters.
- The identity matrix is one that is full of 0's aside from the diagonal full of ones.
- You can find the inverse of a matrix using the function `solve()`.
