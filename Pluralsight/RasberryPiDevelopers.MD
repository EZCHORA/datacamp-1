# Introduction to Rasberry Pi
- It's a compuer.
- Small.
- It's:
  1. Powerful
  2. Inexpensive
- Multiple Versions.
- Intended to run Linux.
- **Default** disto is rasbpian, but others work; I'm using Arch.
- **Scratch** is a visual programming language that should come with it.
- **IDLE** is on there as well, but I'm ssh'ing into it so I wont be using that.
- You can also C/C++ since it's on linux; I will also be using Elixir.
- **General Purpose Output Ports** GP IOs.
- You can send signals to control external hardware using these.
- You can do "lots of stuff" with it.
- Path:
  1. Buy it, duh.
  2. Copy OS Image onto SD card.
  3. Hook up Peripherals.
  4. Power Up!
- `ssh <ip> -l <username>`.
- `sudo apt-get install tightvncserver`.
- Open a windows session using `sudo vncserver :1`.
- Then, use a RealVNC to connect to it.
- Or, an Open Source version called VNC Viewer.
