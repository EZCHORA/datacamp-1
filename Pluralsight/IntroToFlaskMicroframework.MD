# Introduction to the Flask Microframework
## Reindert-Jan Ekker

# Getting Started
- Steps:
	1. Install Python, Pip.
	2. Install virtualenv
	3. Create project environment
- Should install virtualenvwrapper.
- You want to work in a virtual environment to avoid dependency issues.
- For the wrapped version, issue `workon` instead of `source` to activate.
- To disengage, use `deactivate`.
- Flask creates a map for the app.
- You can see this by starting an interpretor and calling `app.url_map`.
- Flask has a static route that is set up by default.
- Most Flask apps will follow the Model, Template, View approach.
- Models are for encapsulating data.
- Templates tell Flask how to display responses to requests.
- Views are the software component that ties everything together.
