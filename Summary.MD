- Lists can contain different types.
- Python has normal list indexing.
- .. also has negative indexing.
- .. is index-ending exclusive behavior.
- You can leave out the 0 index if you want begin:index.
- Not including a end index overrides the exclusive behavior and you get the full list.
- Index assignments are normal; also supports multi-value replacement.
- Delete single items from a list using `del()`.

- `=` with lists is copy by reference by default; further updating will change both.
- To do a deep copy, use `y = list(x)` or `y = x[:]`.
- You can add `;` to lines to run multiple commands on the same line.
